# HPCDA
(High Performance Computing Data Analysis)

Overview
--------------
HPC Data Analysis is a project for understanding Supercomputers' memory access patterns and analyzing the data from running physical simulations on clusters. The project is based on python as well as its Scikit-learn, SciPy, MatPlotlib and SeaBorn libraries.

Directories
--------------
- data
  The data folder contains all data csv files directly from Mitos or temporary data generated during the analysis process.
- figs
  The figs folder contains all figures generated from the data analysis process.
- src
  The src folder contains main.py as well as all other helper functions, models, and automations.
- tsrc
  The src folder contains some example usage of Scikit-learn machine-learning functions. (Unrelated to the project itself.)
